### Introduction
Addressing the House of Representatives on Thursday, February 24, 1831, Abel Wheeler, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, reported that the power and wealth of France were mainly derived from silk production and that a number of other European countries had embarked on the same path "with zeal."[^1] Conversely, the United States was spending a fortune on foreign silk: between 1821 and 1825 the total value of imported silk was worth approximately $945 million in today’s currency.[^2]  To further his point, Mr. Wheeler compared this vast sum to the revenue generated from US bread exports: a paltry $5 million a year, or about $180 million today. Not only could mulberry leaves—the food of silkworms—be transformed into stacks of cash, but the mulberry tree itself was undemanding, requiring neither good soil nor good climate.[^3] However, as we will discover, despite years of effort to establish sericulture in the U.S, Wheeler's dream of turning leaves into gold came to nothing.

>The only appropriate food for the silkworm is the leaf of the mulberry tree. It should be the first business therefore of the silk grower to provide himself with the source of a constant supply of mulberry leaves.[^4]

Here we tell the story of loss, but also one of renewal and metamorphosis. In the shadows of the fields haunted by white mulberries rose the canopies of another tree: *Morus rubra*, the red mulberry native to North America. While the red mulberry is found almost nowhere else in the world but North America, more often than not it is the white mulberry that comes to mind when we think of a mulberry tree. The white mulberry has captured attention throughout history, both within and outside its native ranges, overshadowing the red mulberry, even in its home continent.

The story of the red mulberry is a less glamorous one than that of the white mulberry and the dreams of riches promised by silk. It is a story earthier in its substance, more of root, trunk, and twig; bark and berry; and the breeze that gets caught in a generous canopy. These are the threads of Indigenous wisdom, landscapes of heritage and memory, in which the red mulberry is a horticultural marvel: a medicine chest, source of food, fiber, wood, and respite. Neglected and overlooked because it was not the favorite food of the silkworm, the red mulberry tree is reclaiming its legacy in the landscapes of North America. It may not be the money tree of silk production like the white mulberry, but as we will discover, every part of the tree offers wealth of its own kind.[^5]

### Taxonomy, Genus, and Types of Mulberry

The mulberry genus *Morus* is part of the family *Moraceae*, which includes mulberries and figs. Even within mulberry species, morphology differs greatly, especially with the white mulberry. It is unclear how many mulberry species listed in the genus are distinct, with estimates ranging from eight to seventeen.[^6] However, the three main types of mulberry are generally considered to be white, red, and black, the most common species of which are the *Morus alba* (white mulberry), *Morus rubra* (red mulberry), and *Morus nigra* (black mulberry).
